# Portfolio Website #

I made this website using Vite & React, and deployed through Cloudflare pages/workers.
This website is just used to showcase my work.

Design & Development of this site were all done by me (^.^)/

How to run:
1. Clone the git repo & run `npm i` in the `portfolio-site` root directory
2. Run `npm run dev` to run the development environment
3. If you decide to push to main just know that this causes a build with Cloudflare and it will go live
